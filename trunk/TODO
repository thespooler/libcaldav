In the nearest future:

	- In the present state there are no support for locking so users
	should be adviced that multiple access to the same calendar is not
	fully functional at the moment.
		- This will be implemented in the nextrelease.

	- Searching free/busy information is lacking (VFREEBUSY).
		- This will be implemented in the next release.

Something to come at a later time:

	- Implement ToDo support 
	- Implement Journal support

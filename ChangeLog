       eliminated
  * 5) Resolve bug in get_response_header which caused function to
       change contents of variable in calling function
  * 6) Added extra variable to get_response_header to decide whether returned
       string should be all lower or not
	7) Function get_tag can now also handle namespace prefix in tags
	8) Added function caldav_getoptions to have a list of supported options
	   by the server returned.
  * 9) Compatibily tests run against Chandler and Apple's ICalendar
       - Chandler: calendar-query not working due to bugs in Chandler's
	     implementation of calendar-query which is not conforming to RFC4791
	   - ICalendar: After adding namespace prefix awareness all test ran as
	     expected.
  * 10) The CLI test application upgraded to use new features.
